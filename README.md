# Railway-Management-System


<br>

# Introduction
<br>

This system is basically concerned with the reservation and cancellation of  railway tickets to the passenger. The need of this system arose because as  is the known fact that India has the largest railway network in the whole  world and it is not possible to handle such a large system manually. By  computerizing it, it became possible to overcome the limitations and make  the system operations more efficient. The complexity in handling data and  records of such a vast system got reduced and became easier by  computerizing the system. 

Being more specific, this online railway reservation system can perform  the basic functions like reservation and cancellation. The users are required  to register on the server for getting access to the database and query result  retrieval. Upon registration completion, each user has an account which is  essentially referred to as the ‘view level’ of the customer.





 The account  contains comprehensive information of the user entered during the  registration and allows the user to access their past reservations,  cancellations, enquire about trains and train schedule, seat availability and  make afresh reservations. The user will also be able to update their account  details, etc.  
The master user of this system is the Railway Administrator who can login  using a master password and once a user is authenticated as the admin,  he/she can access and modify information stored in the database of this  system. This includes adding and updating of train, station, train routes and  also managing the user and the passenger details.
